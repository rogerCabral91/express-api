## Requirements

Before starting, you will need to have the following tools installed on your machine:
[Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).
Also it's nice to have an editor to work with code like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the extension [Thunder Client](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rangav.vscode-thunder-client), or an application like [Postman](postman.com) or [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/)

## Running the API

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/rogerCabral91/express-api.git

# Access the project folder in the terminal/cmd
$ cd express-api

# Install dependencies
$ npm install

# Run the application
$ npm start

# The server will start on port:3003 - go to <http://localhost:3003>
```
## Using the API
### Create
In the API client use the POST method to insert data via form-encode passing the name and price keys with their respective values through Body Request;

### Read
To list ALL values use the GET method in '/products';
To list a specific entry use the GET method passing as parameter the desired ID, for example, 'products/2';

### Update
Use the same creation procedure but using the PUT method and passing the ID of the entry you want to update as a parameter, for example, 'products/7' changing the name to 'Updated Product' and the price to 9.99;

### Delete
Using the DELETE method, pass as a parameter the ID you want to delete, for example, delete the item ID 4;

## Technologies
